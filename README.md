What is Static Type Checking?

    Static Checking is when something, like your compiler, runs before your code and checks for errors

    Type Checking is making sure the variables that you are using fit the current context

    Ex. You’re not trying to subtract a string from a numbers ⇒ 7 - “Words”

    Static Type Checking is when something, like TypeScript, will detect the typing errors in your code, before it runs.
